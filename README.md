  ## Code Break Down:

  ## 1) The most important file the server. This file begins the app and on top of that here I declare all the packages and dependencies I want my app to use.

  ## 2) Next, we move on to make a connection. I need to make sure I connect to MongoDB.

  ## 3) In this file I make the models. Sticking with mongoose to make my schemas.

  ## 4) Once everything is in place I beging to buld the functions that will relay the needed steps to create, update, post or delete data.
